This is a web app I designed to simplify scheduling for people who work irregluar schedules or 'rotations' like firefighters or police officers. 
Often times police will work a schedule that is not effected by weekends or holidays making days on and off hard to track more than a few days into the future.
This app is designed to simplify that process by allowing the user to input how many days they work in a typical week, followed by how many days off they would have, then the user can decide how far into the future they would like to see their individual schedule, then select a starting date to begin the schedule on.
The app also saves user input in local storage.
